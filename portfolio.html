      <h3>Buddha on Red Berries</h3>
      <p>In this piece I used Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Lightroom.
        I took a photo of a small Buddha statue I had laying around,
        and combined it with other photos of red berries I took around campus.
        I collaged 5 different photos of the berries in order to get a big bundel of
        berries for the statue to sit on. Then I added some custom brushes with a
        water splash effect.
      </p>

      <img src="images/buddha_blue.png"alt="Buddha on Blue Berries">
      <h3>Buddha on Blue Berries</h3>
      <p>This piece had a similar process as the Buddha on Red Berries, except
        I used a second statue in a black color.
        Here I collaged a different set of berries. I also used a custom brush
        with a smokey effect, as well as the other water splash brush. Since, this
        statue was black I decided to change the hue on the berries to blue.
      </p>

      <img src="images/smokeyBuddha.jpg" alt="A buddha on smokey berries">
      <h3>A Buddha on Smokey Berries</h3>
      <p>Of the three Buddha pieces I made this is perhaps my favorite one.
        In comparison, it is more dynamic with it's 3/4 angle, the smokey effect
        is more imposing and elegant, and it also has some movement that can be read
        as though the Buddha is floating from right to left.
      </p>

      <img src="images/eggato.png" alt="Florence Villa on an Egg">
      <h3>Florence Villa on an Egg</h3>
      <p>This is one of my favorite pieces. It just has that "why?" factor.
        No one asked me to put a villa on an egg but I did and it looks great.
        I had a lot of fun making this one and it was actually very easy to make.
        There was really no plan here other than playing with perspective
        and lighting. It was tricky to get the shot of the egg, even had to
        make a small stand for the egg so it would sit up straight.
      </p>

      <img src="images/Collage.png" alt="Collage of Cal State East Bay">
      <h3>Collage of Cal State East Bay</h3>
      <p>In contrast to Florence Villa on an Egg, this was my least
        favorite piece to make. I like how it turned out but the
        process was painfully tedious.
        For this piece I frankensteined more than 10 different photos in one.
        It took forever!, but it was worth it.
      </p>

      <img src="images/ol_chevy.jpg" alt="Old Chevrolet truck" class="float-center">
      <h3>Ol' Chevy</h3>
      <p>I always enjoy traditional media a little more than digital, which is why
          this piece is one of my all-time favorites. For this one I used oil pastels.
          The idea behind this piece was the concept of Earth after humans and how
          nature would take over any man-made objects, in this case an old Chevrolet pick-up.
      </p>

      <img src="images/dwayne_bird_web.png" alt="Dwayne the Bird Johnson" class="float-center">
      <h3>Dwayne the "Bird" Johnson</h3>
      <p>Dwayne the Bird Johnson is another piece with a "why?" factor to it. I did
        this one out of pure fun. There used to be a trend where people would phototshop
        arms on birds and it was just too great not to try it.
        Then this came out...I regret nothing.
      </p>

      <img src="images/dark_sam_web.png" alt="Dark Sam" class="float-center">
      <h3>Dark Sam</h3>
      <p>Here's another of my favorite pieces, maybe even my favorite in general.
        The idea was to turn my friend Sam into a monster or some mythical creature.
        I mainly focused on lighting because I wanted to convey a surreal and
        dark tone in the piece. Because of this way the piece fells grim but not gothic.

        Headline</a>Headline</h3>
        <p>This is a short video I made in Final Cut Pro. The idea behind it was
        to make a headline for an article. The article was about how videogames
        are rising into a bigger industry than it was in the 80's and 90's.
        Based on the videogame theme I pulled some of my favorite videogame characters
        and made them part of the headline</p>
