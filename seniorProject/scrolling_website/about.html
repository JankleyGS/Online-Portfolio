         <h2 id="title">About This Site</h2>
          <p>This site is inspired from the poem 'The Tripping Tadpole' (Rin Rin Renacuajo)
            by Colombian poet Rafael Pombo. I first came across this story when I was about 6 years old.
            I found the book laying on the street on my way home from school.
            Out of curiosity I picked up the book and skimmed through the pages.
            The books was beautifully illustrated with hand-drawn pictures and watercolored lanscapes.
            I wasn't much of a reader back then, but I was so amazed by the illustrations
              I decided perhaps the book was worth reading.
          </p>

          <p>The story is about a young tadpole named Rinrin. In the story, Rinrin goes out with a suit and time
          even though, his mom tells him not to leave the house. He ignores her and strolls away.
          Later he finds his friend the Mouse who invites him to visit Lady Rat for some feast and dancing.
          Rinrin accepts and they both go tripping to Lady Rat's. She welcomes them in
          and both Rinrin and Mouse joing her in the feast.</p>

          <p>After sometime of partying, a cat shows up and snaches both Mouse and Lady Rat.
          To Rinrin's dismay, the cat eats both his friends in one gulp. Rinrin darts out the door
          and runs (or hops) as fast as he can. Unfortunately, he ends up jumping into
          a duck's mouth and is swallowed immediately, leaving his mom sad and lonely.
          Good times!</p>
