      <h3>The Triplicata</h3>
        <p><span>Project Triplicata</span> exists in three parts; a physical one, in the
            form of a sculpture, and two virtual ones, in the form of this website
            and the illustrations. The main idea was to play with the concept of
            dimensionality by combining different media. I wanted to show my skills
            across different disciplines, as well as creating an object that could
            be considered “multidimensional.” What I mean by this is that, since
            it is a multimedia project it had to have different media at play.
            In the process of applying these different media the project took a
            different entity. It was no longer just a website, or a sculpture,
            or a series of illustrations; rather it was a project that existed
            in both the physical as well as the digital world. The illustrations
            serve as the content for the website. The website itself serves as
            the platform for the illustrations, while the sculpture anchors
            both by displaying the QR codes that link to the website.
        </p>

        <p>The illustrations have a concept of their own, as well. It started
          out as a way to validate my need to draw beings of fantasy, since I
          was not allowed to do an illustration book as my project. In order to
           have cohesiveness, I decided to base the illustrations on people I
            saw everyday during the winter of 2017-18. The creature of fantasy
             would be determined by the mythology of the person’s cultural
             background. For instance, the friend I ride the bus with is from
             India, and practices the Hindu religion. Thus, the creature I based
             them off of was the Hindu god, Vishnu. Instead of him sitting across
              from me, it is Vishnu who takes the seat. I implemented this idea
               with the rest of the illustrations, limiting the number of
               illustrations to 6 due to a tight deadline.
        </p>

        <p>The sculpture came to be from my fascination with impossible geometry.
          Referencing objects like the tesseract I attempted to make an object
          that almost defied physics, or at the very least looked unnatural in
          its composition. The name Triplicata is Latin for triplicate, and it
          is defined as existing in three copies. Individually, each component
          is capable of standing as a separate project, with the website as a
           more minimalistic work with just bits of data.
